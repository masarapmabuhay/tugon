# GitHub Game Off 2021 Lessons-learned Report

## Name (Last Name, First Name)* 
SYSON, MICHAEL B.

## 1) Were the work goals met?*
YES

## 2) Was work successful?*
YES

## 3) Your reflections on #1 & #2?*
Despite the variances in what we expected to be the required inputs and outputs to WIN in GitHub Game Off 2021, we were able to finish using SAVED TIME that we received from system efficiency with work. This is without adding excess stress by attempting to add more with decreasing available TIME.

## 4) Give comments on the use of project management tools and techniques.*
We did NOT need to create a GANTT CHART;
Instead, we attempted to create an application during GitHub Game Off 2021,
without having a FINAL application in a plan ready at the start. 

With the Intel Game Development Competition Year 2008, we already had such plan;
Based on my existing notes, we were looking into the gameplay of God of War.

In addition, for GitHub Game Off 2021, we intended the output application to be executable even with recycled, albeit unused machines.

We further reduced the output file size by using select Libraries to execute compression techniques, e.g. for Image and Audio files.
We did NOT add the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) anymore due to noticeable lags in execution with the machines.

The output file size CAN fit in a diskette (<1.44MB).

## 5) What are the causes of variances (i.e. difference between what is expected and what is actually accomplished)?*
observed: updates in the JAM's chosen ITCH.IO platform during GitHub Game Off 2021<br/>
--> Example#1: Applications were NOT downloadable immediately at select regions<br/>
--> Example#2: Comments began to include the Developer's Submitted Entry<br/>
<br/>
learned: after verifying end results, overall RANKING was based on the number of RATINGs;<br/>
--> Example#1: Those who received 7 RATINGS were given higher RANK than those with lesser RATINGS;<br/>
--> This is despite the scores from the Entry with the lesser RATING were higher.<br/>

## 6) What is your reasoning behind the corrective actions that your team chose?*
We started by verifying instructions from our existing applications that executed on Windows machines.
However, due to there were more unused Linux machines available, we quickly created a Linux version.
We also used the macOS and the GarageBand Tool to convert to .mp3 file format the Audio file that we recorded using an Android telephone.

## 7) Describe one example of what went right.*
We did NOT experience stress caused by attempting to add more with decreasing available TIME during development.

## 8) Describe one example of what went wrong.*
I set the COMMENTS to off in our GitHub Game Off 2021 Project page after observing that it appeared that those who did NOT even Submit an Entry could POST a comment;
After re-verification, there was an update, such that comments began to include the Developer's Submitted Entry.

## 9) What will you do differently on the next role based on your experience working on this role?*
I shall encourage even more Filipinos, with people, particularly in Southeast Asia, to increase know-how in computers/robots/machines. 
The output of this action is reduced cost for us all.

## 10) Give your personal words of wisdom based on your team's experiences.*
Execute tasks yourself instead of immediately delegating them to people;
We learn how select applications became a certain way after noticing during development that select developers were also working on a similar path, and reached their END Output based on the paths that they chose.
